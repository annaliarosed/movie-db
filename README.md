## why
I chose to use no external design library in order to have complete creative control over design decisions. I created everything custom

## design decisions
I chose bright colors that mimic the excitment of going to a theater with the flashing lights and big posters with warm colors overtones.
I kept it simple for easiest readiability.
I over-rid all default focused styling and customized it for a more unqie and fun experience. and for optimal keyboard accessibility. 
I chose contrasting colors to comply with all accessibility rules
