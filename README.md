# Movie database project

A simple, responsive React app project that utilises loading data via [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)


## Tools used
| Tool           | Why          | 
| :------------- | :----------: | 
| React          | Used in order to make the most out out of reusable components in order to create a fast and scalable application| 
| React Router   | Used to take advantage of the optimization client-side routing provides in React to maintain the seamless user experience that a typical single-page application promises| 
| Jest           | Jest makes it faster and easier to write idiomatic unit tests | 
| Moment         | Chosen to format dates efficiantly to provide readability for the user. |
| Prettier       | In order to be most productive by elimating the need for formatting by hand. |


## Inspiration
This project was chosen in order to provide people with a fun experience while searching for movies or tv shows. I also wanted to showcase the versatility of an open sourced API and display one way it can be interpreted.

## Design decisions

- I chose bright colors that mimic the excitment of going to a theater with the flashing lights and big posters with warm colors.

- I kept it simple with high contrast colors for easy readiability and accessibility.

- I replaced all default focused styling and customized it for a more uniqe experience and for optimal keyboard accessibility.
